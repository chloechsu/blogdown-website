I have always been curious about this world, and I love explorative research. 

I was trained to be a mathematician and computer scientist. 
While I still enjoy thinking about abstract theory, I'm now more interested in
applying research skills to model real-world problems.
In the past year, I've picked up a lot of data analysis tools and techniques along the
way, and I'm excited to keep learning.

When I'm not doing math, I spend time visiting art museums, painting watercolor,
reading modernist fiction,
cooking, and volunteering.

It's hard to summerize my life on one page, but I tried to put together a
timeline of what I've done since college academically.
