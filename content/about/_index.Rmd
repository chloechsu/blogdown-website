title: "About Me"
---

I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Caltech studying math, computer science, and English.

Currently, I'm looking for a data scientist position.

I have always been curious about this world, and I love explorative research. 
I was trained to be a mathematician and computer scientist. 
While I still enjoy thinking about abstract theory, I'm now more interested in
applying research skills to model real-world problems.
Recently, I've picked up a lot of data analysis tools and techniques along the
way, and I'm excited to keep learning.

In the past, I've worked as a quantitative analyst, math researcher, software engineer, and English-Chinese translator.

When I'm not doing math, I spend time visiting art museums, painting watercolor,
reading modernist fiction,
cooking, and volunteering.
