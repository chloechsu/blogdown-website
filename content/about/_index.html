title: "About Me"
---



<p>I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Caltech studying math, computer science, and English.</p>
<p>I have always been curious about this world, and I love explorative research. In the past, I’ve worked as a quantitative analyst, math/computer science researcher, software engineer, and English-Chinese translator.</p>
<p>When I’m not doing math, I spend time visiting art museums, painting watercolor, reading modernist fiction, cooking, and volunteering.</p>
