<p>I have always been curious about this world, and I love explorative research.</p>
<p>I was trained to be a mathematician and computer scientist. While I still enjoy thinking about abstract theory, I’m now more interested in applying research skills to model real-world problems. In the past year, I’ve picked up a lot of data analysis tools and techniques along the way, and I’m excited to keep learning.</p>
<p>When I’m not doing math, I spend time visiting art museums, painting watercolor, reading modernist fiction, cooking, and volunteering.</p>
<p>It’s hard to summerize my life on one page, but I tried to put together a timeline of what I’ve done since college academically.</p>
