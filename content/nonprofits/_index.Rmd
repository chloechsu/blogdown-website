I believe education is very important, especially in socially disadvantaged families and in developing countries. I hope to do what I can to help the future generation through education.

Here are some education nonprofits that I support and volunteer for. The events are really fun so please consider joining!

* [Symposium](https://www.symposiumglobal.org/): Symposium brings literature and humanities education to high school and college students around the world in New York, China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, India, and Singapore. Symposium seminars focus on critical thinking skills and cross-cultural dialogues.
