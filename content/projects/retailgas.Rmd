Consider the following scenario. Suppose I drive about the same distance every
week and I have enough gas left in the tank for another week.
If I know the gas price is going down next week, I could save some money by
waiting till next week to fill up the tank.

With this motivation, it'd be nice to predict retail gas price trends. Compared
to crude oil, retail gas price changes more slowly (larger autocorrelation), so
it might be easier to predict than crude oil.

This project compares three models for predicting weekly trend of retail gas
prices:

1. [Multivariate Rolling Regression](/html/multivariate_rolling_regression.html)
2. [ARIMA](/html/ARIMA_model.html)
3. [Logistic Regression](/html/logistic_regression.html)

<p></p>

The predictors include: crude oil and gasoline spot prices, as well as crude oil
and gasoline stocks.
All data are from [U.S. Energy Information
Administration](https://www.eia.gov).

Logistic regression is the best model for classifying retail gas price trend. Under reasonable assumptions, an average driver would save about \$65 in
2011-2016 in Los Angeles.
